Multilingual bibliographies: The babelbib package
=================================================


This package enables to generate multilingual bibliographies in
cooperation with babel. Two approaches are possible: Each citation
may be written in another language, or the whole bibliography can 
be typeset in a language chosen by the user. The current version 
supports Afrikaans, Bahasa, Catalan, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English,
Esperanto, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian,
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.
  In addition, the package supports commands to change the typography
of the bibliographies.
  Many of the standard and extended bibliography styles are available.

Please help me to add more languages to babelbib.
